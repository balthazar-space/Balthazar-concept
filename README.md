open-hardware laptop computer modules

These are electronic schematic modules as presented at https://balthazar.space/wiki/Balthazar
with the main aim for team access

We are building it from periphery - inwards.

KiCad 5.1.5 files

1. module BalthazarPSU is a combined battery charger, buck-boost coverter and stereo power amplifier. 

2. module BalthazarKeyboard is a simplified a bit ergonomic computer keyboard with a bit "diy" approch.

So-far no prototype was built yet - these are preliminary files to be checked in practise.

Some philosophy is in the .pdf files included.

CERN Open Hardware Licence CERN-OHL W V.2.0
Version 2.0 of the CERN-OHL introduces three variants of the licence – strongly (S) reciprocal, weakly (W) reciprocal and permissive (P) – which aim to address specific constraints caused by different collaboration models currently used in open-hardware projects. 
The first two variants mean that if any product is made using an open hardware design, the design of that product, including any improvements or modifications, should be made available under the same licence as that of the original product. Permissive licences do not impose this condition.
